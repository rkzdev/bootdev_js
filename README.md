# bootdev_js

Hi I'm Raven from Philippines and this is just for learning purposes.

I want to improve my programming skills, and I'm watching one of <https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen> videos and he mentioned about this website <https://www.boot.dev> where you can learn.
Of course I checked the website and registered just to check what are the courses, there is python, javascript and go.
Its a text based game to learn programming. I tried python, just to see how it works and I really liked it (base on what I can do as a Guest). I did some
assignments and move on to the next. Until the website disable some functionality like submit to check my assignment if it is correct. I really love to be a member but unfortunately I'm broke right now ðŸ¤¦.

But I really want to continue learning the fundamentals especially javascript. Since the next button was not disabled, I can still go to the next chapter to read and try the assignment in my computer. The downside is I really don't know if I did the assignments correctly.
Check <https://www.boot.dev/> they did a geat job and if you have the money I suggest to become a member specially for beginners. Each lesson is easy to follow, understand, and not boring to read

I'm still reading today. I hope its not illegal to do this
